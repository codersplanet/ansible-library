# Ansible Library

Ansible Library is a minimal galaxy implementation, intended to allow serve
private roles from local storage and behave as proxy towards ansible galaxy.

It is intended to allow role installs with standard tools, although it requires
a minor patch to ansible-galaxy, that enables

    ansible-galaxy install --server=http://local-galaxy:3333 private-role,v1.4

## Usage

Just download the server in your prefered location and run

    $ ansible-library.py

which starts the server listening on port 3333.

On startup, it searchs all files under a configurable directory, and uses the
presence of `meta/main.yml` is used to decide whether it is a role or not. The
name and version are assigned following the github download standards, that is

    /var/lib/galaxy/<rolename>/<roleversion>.tar.gz

Default behaviour is to run as a foreground process, but it can fork itself and
run as daemon process.

### Maintenance

Besides the galaxy specific endpoints (`/api/v1/`), there is an additional
operation for library maintenance. Making a PUT to `/api/reload`, the cache
will be cleaned and the local roles reloaded from disk. This operation acts
as a warm restart, and is mainly intended to make visible new role versions
copied under the local roles directory.

### Role uploading

Appart from copying roles into the library directory, it is possible to upload
packed roles just by performing a PUT request with the role file to
`/<rolename>/<roleversion>`, and the server will copy it to the right place and
add to its list of available roles.

### Configuration

Some internal parameters can be override by setting them on a configuration
file, which is a yaml one named `/etc/ansible-library.yml`. The configurable
parameters and their default values are

    roles_dir: /var/lib/galaxy
    logfile: None
    listen: 0.0.0.0
    port: 3333
    ttl: 3600
    daemonize: False
    piddir: None
    debug: False
